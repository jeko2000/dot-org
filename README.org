* Org mode Configuration

My [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] configuration for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] conveniently written as an org file.

The first level headings for the configuration mirror those from the
org manual as that was my main source of information for this
configuration.

* Setup

To use this configuration, first clone the repository as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/jeko2000/dot-org.git
#+END_SRC

Then, add the following or equivalent to your .emacs or .init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((org-config-file "~/location/of/dot/org.org"))
  (when (file-exists-p org-config-file)
    (org-babel-load-file org-config-file nil)))
#+END_SRC
